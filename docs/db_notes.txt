
Notes on Database "Schema"

  1. Users will be in the _users database.
  2. Images are in the rop_images database.
  3. Results go in image_compare_results.
  
In addition, rop_images will contain the concept of tasks. Task documents are basically
an ordered list of comparisons.

TaskExecutors remember a task, a user, and the index of the last recorded result.

TaskList Feeder will find TaskExector documents with the current user. The first 
unfinished task will be resumed.
